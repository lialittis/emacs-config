# What is color-rg?

color-rg is a search and refactoring tool based on ripgrep.

I'm a big fan of color-moccur.el, this extension's name is a tribute to
color-moccur.el!

## Installation

Clone or download this repository (path of the folder is the
`<path-to-color-rg>` used below).

In your `~/.emacs`, add the following two lines:

```Elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-color-rg>") ; add color-rg to your load-path
(require 'color-rg)
```

If you use Mac, you also need to install
[exec-path-from-shell](https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell)

### Work with isearch

Add this into your emacs config file:

```
(define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "M-s M-s") 'isearch-toggle-color-rg)
```

When using `isearch-forward`, type <kbd>M-s M-s</kbd> to search current
isearch string with color-rg.

### Research with new files

`color-rg-rerun-change-files` can limit search files with GLOB. This function
used rg arguments '--type', '--add-type'.

Default search files is "everything" which means use rg without '--type'
argument.

If search files is "all", search rg like "rg --type all".

Other complete candidates are mostly read from "rg --type-list" command, which
is predefined in rg.

Of course you can specify your own GLOB, just insert them as you like. For
example, if you input a GLOB like `*mypersonalglob*`, which match none of the
candidates, then, color-rg will call shell command like:

```
rg --add-type 'custom:*mypersonalglob*' --type custom ...
```

### Research with customized arguments

If none of the preset meet your requirements, `color-rg-customized-search` can
release the full power of `rg`.

When `color-rg-customized-search` is called, the full command of rg will show
up, and you can add any argument to rg as in shell.

you must escape special characters when using `color-rg-customized-search`, for
example:

```
rg --type-add custom\:\*.el
# or
rg --type-add 'custom:*.el'
# or
rg --type-add "custom:*.el"
```

### Works with Windows
Some user need add `powershell` before start command `rg`, you need custom option `color-rg-command-prefix`

### Multi-line search
color-rg support rg option `-U` default, you can pass regex string `find-file.*\n(goto-char` to match code block that first line is start with `find-file` and second line start with `goto-char`

### Show match-line context
When you set `color-rg-show-lines-before-match` or `color-rg-show-lines-after-match`, color-rg will pass number to option `-B` or `-A`, to show context around match line.
