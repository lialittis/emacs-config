* Ample Themes
  [[http://melpa.org/#/ample-theme][file:http://melpa.org/packages/ample-theme-badge.svg]]
  - A Triplet of themey goodness.
  - Full colored gui and modern 256 color terminal support only.
** Installation
    Ample Theme is on Melpa, ensure that Melpa is added to your package archives, then use ~M-x~ ~package-install~ ~ample-theme~.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      ;; then in your init you can load all of the themes
      ;; without enabling theme (or just load one)
      (load-theme 'ample t t)
      (load-theme 'ample-flat t t)
      (load-theme 'ample-light t t)
      ;; choose one to enable
      (enable-theme 'ample)
      ;; (enable-theme 'ample-flat)
      ;; (enable-theme 'ample-light)

      ;; Or, if you use `use-package', do something like this:
      (use-package ample-theme
        :init (progn (load-theme 'ample t t)
                     (load-theme 'ample-flat t t)
                     (load-theme 'ample-light t t)
                     (enable-theme 'ample-flat))
        :defer t
        :ensure t)
    #+END_SRC
** Easy Customization
   You can use the following example to customize ample theme in a way that won't affect other themes.

   For example, some users prefer to use a different color for strings or the region for more contrast.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (with-eval-after-load "ample-theme"
       ;; add one of these blocks for each of the themes you want to customize
       (custom-theme-set-faces
         'ample
         ;; this will overwride the color of strings just for ample-theme
         '(font-lock-string-face ((t (:foreground "#bdba81"))))))
   #+END_SRC
** If you get ugly colors in terminal:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     # throw this in your ~/.bash_profile
     export TERM="xterm-256color"
   #+END_SRC
